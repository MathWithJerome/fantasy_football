# Fantasy Football
I've put together two optimization modelse for different fantasy football games -- best ball and captain.

## Best Ball
Best ball is a season long game where fantasy managers select a set of players (typically 18 or 20) for the entire season with no ability to change thte roster in any way. Each week, points are accrued using te best lineup from a manager's roster (automatically). 

## Captain Mode
This format is for a single NFL game and thus a daily fantasy game, where managers select 6 players of any position (subject to a salary cap). One playe that is selected is the *captain*, which multiplies that player's salary and points scored by 1.5x.
